### Project Solution

- [x] Task 1: Answers to all the pennylane codebooks from "Introduction to Quantum Computing", "Single-Qubit Gates" and "Circuits with Many Qubits".
- [x] Task 2: A variational classifier tutorial notebook from <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_variational_classifier/> with some comments
- [x] Task 3: A quanvolutional neural networks tutorial notebook from <https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/tutorial_quanvolution/> with some comments
- [x] Task 4: A notebook explaining step-by-step how to create a quantum machine learning model reproducing the sine function.
- [x] Task 5: A notebook explaining step-by-step how to create a classical-to-quantum transfer learning model for conspicuity detection in production.

Notebooks in tasks 1 to 4 can be run by creating a virtual environment with `$ pipenv sync`. `qtl.ipynb` in task 5 was run on Google Colab.
